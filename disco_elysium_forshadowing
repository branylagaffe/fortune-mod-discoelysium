SHIVERS - Something is on its way. Something hidden. It's coming, a miracle -- from the northwest -- and it's almost here. You can feel it in the air on your hands, the cold spring air smoothing them over.
%
SHIVERS - The hair on your arms stands up... electricity. Sounds like reeds hissing.
%
SHIVERS - The ruins of a half-sunken seafort crumble on an inlet. Beyond the Bay of Revachol, ghosts rise into the sky.
%
SHIVERS - There is a sound. Something in the reeds, when the wind combs through them. On the inlet, on the little islands there between castaway tyres.
%
SHIVERS - A cold breeze hisses through dense thickets of reeds.... Something sweet in it, somnolent. A damp chill goes down your spine. When you look around, you're still in the Whirling-in-Rags.
%
SHIVERS - The wind rises. So do the hairs on your back. Somewhere West, small bubbles rise from a plastic ball floating in the water -- rusty, the colour of over-steeped tea. Long, spindly arms are spinning the buoy around, turning it, inspecting it like a magic eight-ball, trying to find a way to snap it open... NOTHING IS USELESS.
%
SHIVERS - Yes, spindly extremities have been here, snapped the cords keeping the buoy in place. A little longer -- and it will be floating somewhere out in the open sea...Moves across the water, leaving no traces. You're cold again, as always...
%
SHIVERS - COME OUTSIDE. You - What?

SHIVERS - Far away and outside... the reeds hiss with desperation. Step out.
%
SHIVERS - A serpentine strip of land weaving its way into the Martinaise inlet. Unfortunates on the run -- from the law, from themselves -- sometimes hide out on nearby islets. Little dots in the ocean that are occasionally submerged when the tide is high and the weather foul. The remains of a camp on a jagged piece of rock -- a tent, old dishes and cutlery. Long since abandoned. A hermit crab scuttles among the debris, looking for a new shell.
%
SHIVERS - IT'S TIME TO GO TO THE ISLAND.
%
SHIVERS - ...the wrinkled fingers of an old man crush flower petals. Then sprinkle them in the stream, like white salt.
%
GARY, THE CRYPTOFASCIST - There's lots of weird stuff out here in the reeds, though -- insects, trash. Could be the wind shifting some garbage nearby.

SHIVERS - Every day, the wind shifts the reeds and whatever was left in them: tambourines and condom wrappers, plastic and glass bottles, the smell of decay.

PERCEPTION (HEARING) - The sound you heard was not the sound of something easily abandoned.
%
YOU - To the west.

PERCEPTION (HEARING) - A silent hiss, sea air moving through the needles of a pine tree.
%
PERCEPTION (HEARING) - A flake of snow falls on an extinguished camp-fire. Hiss...
%
PERCEPTION (HEARING) - A drop of rain falls on a black log. Of an extinguished camp-fire.
%
PERCEPTION (HEARING) - You hear a low frequency hiss, barely. Beneath the audible spectrum. Then it's gone.
%
YOU - Which was it that killed you, then -- love or communism?

THE HANGED MAN - Huh?

YOU - You said love killed you, but when you fell down you said it was communism.

THE HANGED MAN - You're misquoting me, Roonie. I said communism killed me. Love *DID ME IN*.

RHETORIC - You really need to learn the difference, buddy. This is embarrassing.
%
COALITION WARSHIP ARCHER - "We're listening. What did you learn about the victim"

YOU - "He said it was *communism* that killed him"

EMPATHY - Oh dear, you seem to be losing the thread.

RHETORIC - Don't listen to them, *everyone* loves a good political angle.

COALITION WARSHIP ARCHER - "We're afraid we're not following. Did you speak with the victim *before* his death"

YOU - "Let's say I have my ways of knowing these things."
%
PERCEPTION (HEARING) - A jitter. A sound impatient to happen, but not yet in this world.

INLAND EMPIRE - You hear some kind of limb fidget, producing an imperceptible tick...
%
INLAND EMPIRE - The words *washed away* sound distant and strange suddenly. Somewhere far away, a dog barks.
%
INLAND EMPIRE - In the West is the miracle...
%
YOU - Is this... the miracle?

INLAND EMPIRE - No. The miracle is still waiting. This is the darkness.

YOU - But aren't I... way out in the West?

INLAND EMPIRE - You are. Soon it will happen.
%
INLAND EMPIRE - Rising, unfolding from the reeds on a hot summer's day... like a benevolent god.
%
INLAND EMPIRE - But you feel the dried flower in your hand somehow still *does* matter. Although not to this sad old man.
%
YOU - "Now that you mention it, I learned something *very* strange about the victim in my murder investigation"

COALITION WARSHIP ARCHER - "We're listening. What did you learn about the victim"

YOU - "I heard that something 'miraculous' was coming, from way out west"

EMPATHY - Oh dear, you seem to be losing the thread.

INLAND EMPIRE - No, this is right. Who doesn't long to believe in *miracles*?

COALITION WARSHIP ARCHER - "Come again? Something 'miraculous,' you say"

YOU - "From the northwest, specifically"

COALITION WARSHIP ARCHER - "We're afraid we aren't quite following. *Who* told you all this, exactly"

YOU - "I'm not really sure. Maybe the hairs along my arm? I'm still trying to figure that part out."
%
EMPATHY - Poor guy... suddenly you get a feeling that insects are important to the case somehow. It's hard to say why.
