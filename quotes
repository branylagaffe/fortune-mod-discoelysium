PHYSICAL INSTRUMENT - Inside your chest, the heart beats still with the after-effects of the sound. Imagine if you could harness that power... making it pulse
%
PHYSICAL INSTRUMENT -  Audio waves thump against your rib cage. The speaker set-up makes everything sound much better... but there's a noticeable lack of something.
%
ENDURANCE - What was *that*? Did you just *flinch* before your own reflection?

YOU - I did not.

ENDURANCE - Yes, you did. There's no use denying it...

ENDURANCE - The problem is obvious: You simply can't hack it. You're a failure. It's all *too much* for you.

YOU - What's too much?

ENDURANCE - Love... time... Revachol... all of it. The pressure is putting you on your knees.
%
ENCYCLOPEDIA - Like the rest of you, it comes from a bad place somewhere in the past. That's all you know for now.
%
MIRROR - Really -- all recollection of the person you are, the people in your life and even the world you're in has drowned in a sea of blood alcohol. This was no mere night of drinking, it was a deluge. Of world-ending proportions.

MIRROR - Really -- all recollection of the person you are, the people in your life and even the world you're in has drowned in a sea of blood alcohol. This was no mere night of drinking, it was a deluge. Of world-ending proportions.

ELECTROCHEMISTRY - With all the synapses you extinguished, it's a miracle you can even think this sentence. You've interrupted a true act of self-annulment here.
%
ENDURANCE - It's time. Time to see yourself as you truly are. It's going to be absolutely *devastating*, but there's no way to avoid it.
%
YOU - (Turn to the dark-haired youth.) Why do you have 'FUCK THE WORLD' written on your jacket?

FUCK THE WORLD - I can answer that. Many men keep searching for *the one*. For so-called true love, which is actually just obsession masquerading as kinship. The thrill of the chase, the hollowness that fills your chest cavity after catching it.

DRAMA - I'm wondering if the poetics come with the jacket or are they derived from something else entirely?

FUCK THE WORLD - To catch a fish you need to hurl the lure many times, and even then it isn't certain that you'll get anything. If you blow up the lake, though...

YOU - Blow it up!

FUCK THE WORLD - ...you get more fish in a shorter time. And, for time is of the essence and fleeting ever so quickly, one must think of a way to fuck the whole world -- and not get caught up in fucking some *one*.

FUCK THE WORLD - Because when one fucks everything, he fucks nothing. And that, to me, feels glorious -- sticking your dick into the void.
%
IDIOT DOOM SPIRAL - It's a hard thing for a man to confront his past. He nods. That's why I avoid mine at all costs.
%
ENDURANCE - You're tired, afraid, sad, hungry and in pain. But most of all: confused. Yet *still*, like a tiny icebreaker -- the tiniest boat in the fleet -- you plough ever forward...
%
SHIVERS - Signage is put up and taken down, shop windows boarded up and reopened once more. What remains constant -- voyeurism, always unhelpful. And, at times, quite fully helpless.
%
THE DESERTER - They'd all drowned in the lower levels, or got torn to shreds above. The anti-aircraft gun had malfunctioned -- so had I. I left them without ideological direction... He opens his eyes and stares right through you. It was real. I'd seen it. I'd seen it *in reality*.

HALF LIGHT - Some kind of great terror. Worse than you've ever seen.

YOU - Seen *what*?

THE DESERTER - The mask of humanity fall from capital. It has to take it off to kill everyone -- everything you love; all the hope and tenderness in the world. It has to take it off, just for one second. To do the deed.

THE DESERTER - And then you see it. As it strangles and beats your friends to death... the sweetest, most courageous people in the world. He's silent for a second. You see the fear and power in its eyes. Then you *know*.

YOU - What?

THE DESERTER - That the bourgeois are not human.
%
PALEDRIVER - They say there is a point -- one that *I* have not crossed -- in the pale superdeep. If you stray too far off course on the U41-A, or in Lomonossov's Land... where every step you take is one step further from home, no matter the direction.

PALEDRIVER - It's a point you cannot come back from. Your mind becomes so radiant with the past -- there is a flip. She flicks the ash from her cigarette. Instead of writing, it erases memory. Nearing some kind of... She shakes her head. Indescribable *finale*.

PALEDRIVER - Maybe you've been down the *Motorway South?* She looks at her cigarette, it's almost out. She has swallowed it hungrily. Then at you...

YOU - The Motorway South?

PALEDRIVER - It's a story us longhaulsmen tell -- longhaulsmen, *xerife*, not *paledrivers* -- way beyond the established pale that's lit by radio frequencies. Where it goes silent.

PALEDRIVER - And dark. And the process begins. Erasure. Kilometre by kilometre. In any direction. The Motorway South is a road you cannot come back from.
%
MAP WALL - It's so small you can't even see it on the map. No... wait. There it is! North of Jamrock, the strip of coast next to the Greater Revachol Industrial Harbour. It looks downright despondent. It's almost Coal City, to be honest.

SHIVERS - No. Coal City is worse. A charred limb. Rain falls on its slick black streets. And then there's the Burnt-Out Quarter in the heart of Jamrock... is it cold in this bookstore, or is it just *you*?

VOLITION - No. This is somewhere to be. This is all you have, but it's still something. Streets and sodium lights. The sky, the world. You're still alive.
%
LIMBIC SYSTEM - Beep-beep-beep! The alarm is ringing, Harry. The disco circus goes on and on! You barely slept three hours last night.

VOLITION - You can do it. It's nothing. Do it for the city. Go.

SHIVERS - Do it for the wind.

LOGIC - Do it for the picture puzzle. Put it all together. Solve the world. One conversation at a time.
%
LILIENNE, THE NET PICKER - People imagine picking up and finding *something better* is an easy solution. But how is that supposed to work, when all your time and energy goes to staying alive? You have almost nothing to set aside to actually fight your way out.
%
ELECTROCHEMISTRY - With an overdose you can at least try to come off it. Take a bath, do breathing exercises, get medical attention as necessary. With an underdose you're just *you*.
%
SHIVERS - In the middle of a broken plaza, in a cone of light barely visible in the daytime, two men, one slim, the other sturdy. They are on the city stage, but only one of them knows his lines...
%
NOVELTY DICEMAKER - "That's why people like role-playing games. You can be whoever you want to be. You can try again. Still, there's something inherently violent even about dice rolls."
%
YOU - Fuck yeah, motherfuckers!

HALF LIGHT - That's the spirit!

HALF LIGHT - Never forget: The whole world's a wooden house and you're a god damn flamethrower.
%
JOYCE MESSIER - "Perhaps." Her earrings chime as she nods. "My intellectual vanity will be my undoing."
%
YOU - No, I wanted to know about the ex-something.

ANCIENT REPTILIAN BRAIN - Ex-love, ex-tenderness. It is foolish of you to resurface to the loss. Not after all the damage you suffered to get here, some of it irreversible... Stay, sail with me through the Abyssopelagic Zone!

YOU - No, I want to get off now. I like pain and burning light and wanting things from people who don't want to give them to me.
%
ANNETTE - "I'm sorry, sir, I don't know how to help you..."

YOU - "Why can't you help me? I'm beyond help, right?"
%
RUBY'S JOURNAL - The first entry is from August 2nd of last year. It reads simply: "I know my position is precarious. All I can do is make myself as useful as I can while looking for a way out. (Remember: no one is indispensable.)"
%
JOYCE MESSIER - "I can't. That's how simple it is. One may dye their hair green and wear their grandma's coat all they want. Capital has the ability to subsume all critiques into itself. Even those who would *critique* capital end up *reinforcing* it instead..."
%
STEBAN, THE STUDENT COMMUNIST - "'In dark times, should the stars also go out?'"
%
INLAND EMPIRE - Your surroundings are undisturbed. While you slept, you were alone. Now that you're awake -- you're still alone.

HALF LIGHT - Get the fuck out of here. Fuck this place, fuck this world, fuck this life, fuck this body -- just fucking go.

SAVOIR FAIRE - The sheets are stained red. Your blood's been running again. Keep it together. Just get out of here and finish this fucking thing.

VOLITION - Harry... I know there's not much to say -- but if nothing else, just remember that you've made it this far. And it's just a bit farther now. Let's finish this.
%
JOYCE MESSIER - She looks up: "It's like the crowning of the world. It's insane. Very *disco*. You'd love it."

YOU - "Well, if you say it's disco..."

JOYCE MESSIER - "See? Everyone finds something worth holding onto in the world -- however wasted its opportunities."

SHIVERS - The cold seeps into you. The air is heavy with 80% humidity.

INLAND EMPIRE - Suddenly you're conscious of yourself standing there, on... whatever this all is. Your arms hang down by your sides.
