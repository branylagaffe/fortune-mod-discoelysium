PHYSICAL INSTRUMENT - Inside your chest, the heart beats still with the after-effects of the sound. Imagine if you could harness that power... making it pulse
%
PHYSICAL INSTRUMENT -  Audio waves thump against your rib cage. The speaker set-up makes everything sound much better... but there's a noticeable lack of something.
%
ENDURANCE - What was *that*? Did you just *flinch* before your own reflection?

YOU - I did not.

ENDURANCE - Yes, you did. There's no use denying it...

ENDURANCE - The problem is obvious: You simply can't hack it. You're a failure. It's all *too much* for you.

YOU - What's too much?

ENDURANCE - Love... time... Revachol... all of it. The pressure is putting you on your knees.
%
ENCYCLOPEDIA - Like the rest of you, it comes from a bad place somewhere in the past. That's all you know for now.
%
MIRROR - Really -- all recollection of the person you are, the people in your life and even the world you're in has drowned in a sea of blood alcohol. This was no mere night of drinking, it was a deluge. Of world-ending proportions.
%
MIRROR - Really -- all recollection of the person you are, the people in your life and even the world you're in has drowned in a sea of blood alcohol. This was no mere night of drinking, it was a deluge. Of world-ending proportions.

ELECTROCHEMISTRY - With all the synapses you extinguished, it's a miracle you can even think this sentence. You've interrupted a true act of self-annulment here.
%
ENDURANCE - It's time. Time to see yourself as you truly are. It's going to be absolutely *devastating*, but there's no way to avoid it.
%
YOU - (Turn to the dark-haired youth.) Why do you have 'FUCK THE WORLD' written on your jacket?

FUCK THE WORLD - I can answer that. Many men keep searching for *the one*. For so-called true love, which is actually just obsession masquerading as kinship. The thrill of the chase, the hollowness that fills your chest cavity after catching it.

DRAMA - I'm wondering if the poetics come with the jacket or are they derived from something else entirely?

FUCK THE WORLD - To catch a fish you need to hurl the lure many times, and even then it isn't certain that you'll get anything. If you blow up the lake, though...

YOU - Blow it up!

FUCK THE WORLD - ...you get more fish in a shorter time. And, for time is of the essence and fleeting ever so quickly, one must think of a way to fuck the whole world -- and not get caught up in fucking some *one*.

FUCK THE WORLD - Because when one fucks everything, he fucks nothing. And that, to me, feels glorious -- sticking your dick into the void.
%
IDIOT DOOM SPIRAL - It's a hard thing for a man to confront his past. He nods. That's why I avoid mine at all costs.
%
ENDURANCE - You're tired, afraid, sad, hungry and in pain. But most of all: confused. Yet *still*, like a tiny icebreaker -- the tiniest boat in the fleet -- you plough ever forward...
%
SHIVERS - Signage is put up and taken down, shop windows boarded up and reopened once more. What remains constant -- voyeurism, always unhelpful. And, at times, quite fully helpless.
%
THE DESERTER - They'd all drowned in the lower levels, or got torn to shreds above. The anti-aircraft gun had malfunctioned -- so had I. I left them without ideological direction... He opens his eyes and stares right through you. It was real. I'd seen it. I'd seen it *in reality*.

HALF LIGHT - Some kind of great terror. Worse than you've ever seen.

YOU - Seen *what*?

THE DESERTER - The mask of humanity fall from capital. It has to take it off to kill everyone -- everything you love; all the hope and tenderness in the world. It has to take it off, just for one second. To do the deed.

THE DESERTER - And then you see it. As it strangles and beats your friends to death... the sweetest, most courageous people in the world. He's silent for a second. You see the fear and power in its eyes. Then you *know*.

YOU - What?

THE DESERTER - That the bourgeois are not human.
%
PALEDRIVER - They say there is a point -- one that *I* have not crossed -- in the pale superdeep. If you stray too far off course on the U41-A, or in Lomonossov's Land... where every step you take is one step further from home, no matter the direction.

PALEDRIVER - It's a point you cannot come back from. Your mind becomes so radiant with the past -- there is a flip. She flicks the ash from her cigarette. Instead of writing, it erases memory. Nearing some kind of... She shakes her head. Indescribable *finale*.

PALEDRIVER - Maybe you've been down the *Motorway South?* She looks at her cigarette, it's almost out. She has swallowed it hungrily. Then at you...

YOU - The Motorway South?

PALEDRIVER - It's a story us longhaulsmen tell -- longhaulsmen, *xerife*, not *paledrivers* -- way beyond the established pale that's lit by radio frequencies. Where it goes silent.

PALEDRIVER - And dark. And the process begins. Erasure. Kilometre by kilometre. In any direction. The Motorway South is a road you cannot come back from.
%
MAP WALL - It's so small you can't even see it on the map. No... wait. There it is! North of Jamrock, the strip of coast next to the Greater Revachol Industrial Harbour. It looks downright despondent. It's almost Coal City, to be honest.

SHIVERS - No. Coal City is worse. A charred limb. Rain falls on its slick black streets. And then there's the Burnt-Out Quarter in the heart of Jamrock... is it cold in this bookstore, or is it just *you*?

VOLITION - No. This is somewhere to be. This is all you have, but it's still something. Streets and sodium lights. The sky, the world. You're still alive.
%
LIMBIC SYSTEM - Beep-beep-beep! The alarm is ringing, Harry. The disco circus goes on and on! You barely slept three hours last night.

VOLITION - You can do it. It's nothing. Do it for the city. Go.

SHIVERS - Do it for the wind.

LOGIC - Do it for the picture puzzle. Put it all together. Solve the world. One conversation at a time.
%
LILIENNE, THE NET PICKER - People imagine picking up and finding *something better* is an easy solution. But how is that supposed to work, when all your time and energy goes to staying alive? You have almost nothing to set aside to actually fight your way out.
%
ELECTROCHEMISTRY - With an overdose you can at least try to come off it. Take a bath, do breathing exercises, get medical attention as necessary. With an underdose you're just *you*.
%
SHIVERS - In the middle of a broken plaza, in a cone of light barely visible in the daytime, two men, one slim, the other sturdy. They are on the city stage, but only one of them knows his lines...
%
NOVELTY DICEMAKER - "That's why people like role-playing games. You can be whoever you want to be. You can try again. Still, there's something inherently violent even about dice rolls."
%
YOU - Fuck yeah, motherfuckers!

HALF LIGHT - That's the spirit!

HALF LIGHT - Never forget: The whole world's a wooden house and you're a god damn flamethrower.
%
JOYCE MESSIER - "Perhaps." Her earrings chime as she nods. "My intellectual vanity will be my undoing."
%
YOU - No, I wanted to know about the ex-something.

ANCIENT REPTILIAN BRAIN - Ex-love, ex-tenderness. It is foolish of you to resurface to the loss. Not after all the damage you suffered to get here, some of it irreversible... Stay, sail with me through the Abyssopelagic Zone!

YOU - No, I want to get off now. I like pain and burning light and wanting things from people who don't want to give them to me.
%
ANNETTE - "I'm sorry, sir, I don't know how to help you..."

YOU - "Why can't you help me? I'm beyond help, right?"
%
RUBY'S JOURNAL - The first entry is from August 2nd of last year. It reads simply: "I know my position is precarious. All I can do is make myself as useful as I can while looking for a way out. (Remember: no one is indispensable.)"
%
JOYCE MESSIER - "I can't. That's how simple it is. One may dye their hair green and wear their grandma's coat all they want. Capital has the ability to subsume all critiques into itself. Even those who would *critique* capital end up *reinforcing* it instead..."
%
STEBAN, THE STUDENT COMMUNIST - "'In dark times, should the stars also go out?'"
%
INLAND EMPIRE - Your surroundings are undisturbed. While you slept, you were alone. Now that you're awake -- you're still alone.

HALF LIGHT - Get the fuck out of here. Fuck this place, fuck this world, fuck this life, fuck this body -- just fucking go.

SAVOIR FAIRE - The sheets are stained red. Your blood's been running again. Keep it together. Just get out of here and finish this fucking thing.

VOLITION - Harry... I know there's not much to say -- but if nothing else, just remember that you've made it this far. And it's just a bit farther now. Let's finish this.
%
JOYCE MESSIER - She looks up: "It's like the crowning of the world. It's insane. Very *disco*. You'd love it."

YOU - "Well, if you say it's disco..."

JOYCE MESSIER - "See? Everyone finds something worth holding onto in the world -- however wasted its opportunities."

SHIVERS - The cold seeps into you. The air is heavy with 80% humidity.

INLAND EMPIRE - Suddenly you're conscious of yourself standing there, on... whatever this all is. Your arms hang down by your sides.
%
VOLITION - The road to healing is going to be a long one. Stay the course. You will make it, some day.
%
INLAND EMPIRE - So tell me, how does it feel -- to be close to someone, skin to skin?

YOU - It all comes together now. I was built to be close with other beings.

INLAND EMPIRE - I wonder how long has it been since you last hugged someone?
%
DOLORES DEI - "Oh, yes. This is real darkness. It's not death, or war, or child molestation. Real darkness has love for a face. The first death is in the heart, Harry."
%
INLAND EMPIRE - A tremendous loneliness comes over you. Everybody in the world is doing something without you.
%
YOU - "Listen, please. It helped me realise I canâ€™t let you go *because* loving you is impossible. You're like a star I should follow."

DOLORES DEI - "I'm not a star. I'm a confused young woman, eating your mind. There are no stars. There is no light. There will be no future. There is only this intersection. And the aerodrome. Where I must go, incessantly, brutally -- utterly without redemption or hope."

RHETORIC - The star has gone out. She can not rekindle it. You can not rekindle it. There is nothing within or below matter, just the dull *no* of a mind made up. Just like four billion others. I am so sorry.
%
YOU - I am scared I will never be held or loved in this world again.
%
DAMAGED LEDGER - This one is relatively easy to reconstruct. Overnight on 12/02. a graffito -- nay, a mural! -- appears on an eight story tenement overlooking Central Jamrock. The building is a sparsely inhabited ghost tower, part of a failed real estate development called Grand Couron.

RHETORIC - (Cause of failure: rent too high.)

DAMAGED LEDGER - The mural is enormous. Two silhouettes -- a man and a woman -- are kissing. The text cut into their forms reads:

DAMAGED LEDGER - TRUE LOVE IS POSSIBLE ONLY IN THE NEXT WORLD -- FOR NEW PEOPLE IT IS TOO LATE FOR US WREAK HAVOC ON THE MIDDLE CLASS
%
KIM KITSURAGI - "But you made the *right* decision, the more difficult decision, in my mind, at least."

YOU - "I'm still not sure."

KIM KITSURAGI - "You may feel that way for some time yet. In my experience, when you make the wrong decision, you can tell right away. It's the right decisions that won't leave you alone..."

ESPRIT DE CORPS - Perhaps someday the lieutenant will tell you about some of the decisions that won't leave him alone, but it won't be this day.
%
VOLITION - Subdue the regret. Dust yourself off, proceed. You'll get it in the next life, where you don't make mistakes. Do what you can with this one, while you're alive.

SAVOIR FAIRE - Now that you know it exists -- you can get it another day. It can't hide forever...
%
INLAND EMPIRE - This is a man with a lot of past, but little present. And almost no future.
%
LOGIC - It's more likely that your father wasn't even around to beat you.

EMPATHY - It wasn't your father who beat you, it was the world.
%
DOOR, ROOM #3 - This little depression is all you could inflict on the door.

INLAND EMPIRE - You're just as alone as the last time. Whatever kept you company in this world -- what kept you safe -- has left your side, never to return again.
%
ACELE - She looks you in the eye, her pupils wide, surrounded by a ridiculous amount of make-up.

YOU - "The people who built this world intended it to be better for you, but they failed. It is easier to live in their failure with this by your side." (Tap on the tape recorder.)

ACELE - The wind howls. She remains silent.

EMPATHY - It's real. Tell her.

YOU - "It is not a childish fantasy. It can be a real weapon against what's coming for you now."
%
INSULINDIAN PHASMID - And when you fall we will come to raise you up, bud from you, banner-like, blossom from you and carry you apart in a sky funeral. In honour of your passing. (But not me, because I am just a leaf eater.)

VOLITION - In honour of your will, lieutenant-yefreitor. That you kept from falling apart, in the face of sheer terror. Day after day. Second by second.

INLAND EMPIRE - DETECTIVE

ESPRIT DE CORPS - ARRIVING

AUTHORITY - ON THE SCENE
%
JEAN VICQUEMARE - "Mack, man the door," he gestures Torson to block the doorway, then turns to Minot. "You know what he told me? 'I don't want to get better -- I want to get worse.' Those were his words." He sighs heavily and turns to address the room...
%
SHIVERS - A tremble comes over you, another after-effect of ethanol poisoning perhaps? Feels like leaves do when they rustle in the breeze, somewhere far away, below the Turbine. The 41st and the 57th... The lieutenant was right. It's not about who gets what's North, it's about who doesn't.
%
KIM KITSURAGI - Interesting question. It's a blue forget-me-not. Their motto is: Love, Compassion, Self-Discipline. I think you can gauge what they *want* you to think of them from that.

CONCEPTUALIZATION - Something kind and *usual*.

LOGIC - Something almost self-explanatory.

INLAND EMPIRE - Something ominous.

ELECTROCHEMISTRY - Something even a little feminine, but in a *strict* manner.

PERCEPTION (SIGHT) - Something like the dark blue, serious colour of the early night sky above.
%
BLOATED CORPSE OF A DRUNK - Do you remember the scent of your childhood?

YOU - I was born in a hospital where people usually go to die.
%
YOU - What is Elysium?

BLOATED CORPSE OF A DRUNK - Everything. The pale and the isolas -- on the surface -- the outer magnetosphere... Burning, furious truth, eight thousand years of written history.

BLOATED CORPSE OF A DRUNK - You really dropped the ball, Harry. Four point six billion people -- and you failed every single one of them. You really *fucked up*.
%
LIMBIC SYSTEM - Time to go to work in the shit factory!
%
KIM KITSURAGI - "Every school of thought and government has failed in this city -- but I love it nonetheless. It belongs to me as much as it belongs to you."
%
ENCYCLOPEDIA - The Weiss-Wiesemann coefficient is a ratio designed to reflect the difference in net worth between individuals. When the coefficient is close to 1 (or 100%) it means one person possesses all the net worth among that group of individuals. It's been observed that when the Weiss-Wiesemann coefficient reaches about .96 or so, the laws of physics begin to bend around the high-net-worth individual.
%
YOU - But what about all the things that are wrong *now*?

EMPATHY - *Tsk, tsk*. Just because you live in the *present* doesn't mean you have the right to place your needs above the needs of the *future*...

EMPATHY - You may never live to see the Kingdom of Conscience. Your children may not. Even your *grandchildren* might not. But that's no excuse not to keep working...

LOGIC - What rationality...

COMPOSURE - What sangfroid...

VOLITION - What benevolence...

ELECTROCHEMISTRY - What a fucking joke
%
DAMAGED LEDGER - There's a piece of toilet paper -- or is it cleaning tissue? No, it's toilet paper -- *desperately* sticking to the back of the blue plastic clipboard.

DAMAGED LEDGER - It's a metaphor -- for you.
